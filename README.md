**Open Ended Project - Chess - Hayden Collins**

**Summary**
I am planning on creating a chess GUI, perhaps a simple web server app over the course of multiple open-ended projects. It could
also transition into a final project if I want to dedicate more time to it. For this initial project, 
my aim is to get a baseline level of the board level implementations and logic; moving pieces and updating board states. 

Implementation details: 
The board will be represented by an 8x8 vector filled with Piece objects, with the logic of determining legal moves being 
calculated in classes for each piece. For now, moves will be taken from user input.
